The repository "transformer" is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer architecture from the paper "Attention is all you need". 
It provides a complete implementation of the Transformer model from scratch, which is a popular neural network architecture used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text classification. 

The implementation is done using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.
It is a great resource for anyone interested in learning about the Transformer architecture and its implementation in PyTorch.
